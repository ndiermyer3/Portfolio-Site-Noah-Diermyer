      <p>
        Have you ever surfed the web trying to find the best places to eat, play, or have fun? There are many reviews out there, so I wanted to fix this and put them all in an app where users can search places and be able to send the reviews to
        friends and family. Users can also make their own reviews and comments about anyplace. On this app users can find reviews to anyplace they wish and share them with anyone to insure they pick the right place to hangout, eat, and more.

      <h2>Competitor Research</h2>
      <p>
        I chose two competitor apps to research and review. The two competitor apps are TripAdvisor and Yelp. After reviewing both apps I began to see what worked for them and noted to myself the things that didn't go good. Once I settled what works
        for them and what didn't, I started to create and design.

      <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        After doing hours of competitive research on bigger competition, I begin to create my Low-Fidelity wireframes according to the guidelines from apple and android. Following the guidelines carefully, I designed my Low-Fidelity wireframes

      <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        After putting my thoughts on paper, I began to put my wireframes on the design software Adobe XD so I can start building the perfect app.

      <h2>Haptic Feedback and Gestures</h2>
      <p>
        Haptic feedback gives the user positive or negative feedback, so the user can navigate through the app easier and feel more connected with the app. it makes it an overall better experience for the user.

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Once I got my design onto the software, I began to test the app to all the users and see what they had to say about it. once I got the feedback back I began to make changes to make the app better and smoother. lastly, I tested it one more
        time to make sure the app is ready to go

      <h2>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        In the final design I kept it straight to the point and what the users want. having a detailed log in helps with having a more personal app for the users.
